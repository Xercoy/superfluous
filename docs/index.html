    From the ground up, let&rsquo;s take a look at what we have here.
Infrastructure We have a fresh server ready to do our bidding. We used Terraform to faciliate an automated way to provision that server.
Web Server We wrote a simple web server that says, &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s it.
Docker Container We&rsquo;ve encapsulated our web server in a Docker container for plenty of different reasons. Portability, redundancy, to name just two.

          <h2><a href="https://xercoy.github.io/superfluous/post/004_terraformization/">#004: Terraformization</a></h2>
<div>
  
    So we have our web server and we have our Docker container that our web server is going to live in.
Basically, we have the most basic software portion down, and now we&rsquo;re going to setup the &lsquo;computer&rsquo; its going to run on.
In this project, I&rsquo;ll be using Terraform to create a Digital Ocean Droplet.
Enter Terraform Terraform is a great tool for controlling and organizing infrastructure in a safe and efficient way.

          <h2><a href="https://xercoy.github.io/superfluous/post/003_dockerize/">#003: Dockerize</a></h2>
<div>
  
    Now that we have a basic web server working with some tests, it&rsquo;s time to Dockerize it.
This portion is pretty straightforward. There aren&rsquo;t too many dependencies on it, so I created a Dockerfile that basically opened the default port and started it.
Cue technical, educational stuffs.
Docker is another popular buzzword that fills the internet, with good reason.
In a nutshell, it makes it easy to pack and ship programs.

          <h2><a href="https://xercoy.github.io/superfluous/post/002_makefile/">#002: Makefile</a></h2>
<div>
  
    Make is a build automation tool. It reads directives from a file called a Makefile. People familiar with building or installing Linux application and tools from source will be very familiar with this.
In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, make is oftentimes built in. You can create your own Makefile and have fun with it without needing to install anything.
In addition to building applications, it can perform certain operations related to preparing and manipulating the project.

    First Post! I never formally created a project with most of the knowledge I&rsquo;ve gained ths far, and I wanted to focus on every aspect of the project: how it&rsquo;s built, how the application works, how it&rsquo;s prepared, deployed, etc. I think these posts will be a great introduction into getting a some idea about the &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; stuff we see in web dev; making sense of the buzzwords and learning how things work.
